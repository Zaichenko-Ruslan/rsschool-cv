# Hello everyone, My name is Ruslan, and I want to study IT.
## Life credo:
When I talk about life stance, I stick to the common
expression in sports: "Discipline beats class". After all, even if a
person is very talented, without hard work, he simply does not
realize his potential, and the worst that can happen is to remain
forever promising.

Why I have chosen IT? Because work in IT, like a glass of water in the Sahara  , it adds confidence and you can straighten your back.
## My advantagues:
1. Sociable;
2. Considerate;
3. Considerate;
4. Initiative;
5. Responsible;
6. Aimed at the result;
7. Developed leadership qualities;
8. Confident PC user;
9. English level B1.
